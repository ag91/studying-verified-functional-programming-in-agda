This repository represents roughly my progress in studying Agda
through [[https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2841316][Verified Functional Programming in Agda]] by Aaron Stump.

There are notes around representing my learning, so feel free to pick
in them.

* How to run

Nix is a purely functional package manager. This seems to fit with the
book's spirit. You can install Nix by following the instructions at
https://nixos.org/nix/download.html, or simply by running:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :noeval
curl https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
#+END_SRC

Then just run in the terminal:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :noeval
nix-shell
#+END_SRC

This command will interpret the =default.nix= file present in the root
directory of the repository. It will install Agda 2.5.4.2 and a ready
to use Emacs. Also it will download the Iowa Agda Library (IAL)
developed and used by the author to introduce Agda in the book.
